# 🌍 Building K-Means Clusters for Environmental Factors  

A **machine learning model** that clusters environmental data using **K-Means clustering** to identify patterns in factors like air quality, temperature, and pollution levels.  

## 🚀 Features  

- 📊 **Clusters environmental data** into meaningful groups.  
- 🔍 **Uses K-Means for unsupervised learning**.  
- 📈 **Visualizes clusters for better insights**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**  
- **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization**
